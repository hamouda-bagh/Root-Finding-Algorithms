Brent's Method vs. False Position Method


In this repository, you will find python codes for the Brent's method and the false position method that I wrote for my school project, particulary for the numerical analysis module.
On the one hand, Brent's method is a root-finding algorithm combining the bisection method, the secant method and inverse quadratic interpolation.
On the other hand, is a trial and error technique of using test ("false") values for the variable and then adjusting the test value according to the outcome.
